# Node + Typescript + Jest Template
Just a personal dummy template project. Setting this mf up had more trial-error than coding in assembly back in school. Hopefully one day the js ecosytem will recover from it's current almost unusable state of having to scourge the internet on how to install and setup a simple minimalistic node program with ts and jest that prints hello world.

```bash
npm i
npm run test
```
